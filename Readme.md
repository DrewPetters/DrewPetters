### Highly-skilled, senior web developer with 9+ yrs of experience
####   I'm a highly-skilled, senior web developer with 9+ yrs of experience in responsive web development using React, Angular, Vue, Node, Express, Redux, Next, JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, MongoDB,  PostgreSQL, and the cloud platform at New York's leading IT companies. My work experience runs a wide range of software development, from software architecture, database design to website/web app/mobile app development.
####   I have worked with the Agile development methodology to build test-driven code both as a developer and as a scrum master. 
####   Also, I work well with other team members (mentoring and leadership) and always find the opportunity to brainstorm. 
####   I love creative, innovative companies/clients who focus on improving their products, as well as the growth of their employees.
####   My other interests include sports, music, and gaming.
